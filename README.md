0.1\
Initial release.

0.2\
Now you can adjust the value for the hot and cold period separately.

0.3\
The climate is now a cycle and not a switch that gets turned at the end of each year.
Temperature now rises and falls from day to day and not year to year this will give a bigger variety and a more natural experience.

0.4\
Increased the limits for temperature to 250 and the range for the cycle duration to 1 - 1000.

0.5\
Now the settings you chose at game start are saved inside the current sessions save file.
When reaching a normal, hot or cold peak the cycle will stay at peak temperature for 3 – 7 days.
You can now see how the cycle currently affects your temperature inside the tool tip.

0.6\
Added option to start with the cold period first instead of the hot one by turning “invert cycle” in the options to true.

0.7\
Added a dynamic tool tip to the mod menu with information about the cycle duration.
Tweaked temperature peaks.\
